    <h1>Bulls and Cows game</h1>
    <p class='introduction'><strong>Bulls and Cows</strong> (also known as <strong>Cows and Bulls</strong> or <strong>Pigs and Bulls</strong> or
      <strong>Bulls and Cleots</strong>) is an old code-breaking mind or paper and pencil game for two or more players,
      predating the commercially marketed board game <em>Mastermind</em>. It is a game that may date back a century or more
      which uses numbers or words.</p>

    <div class='info'>
    <p>This version is usually played orally, but is easier to play if each player (or each team) keeps written notes. It is
      exactly like the numerical version except instead of 4-digit numbers, 4-letter words are used. They must be real words,
      according to whatever language or languages you are playing the game in. Alternate versions of the game can be played
      with 3-letter or 5-letter words, but the 4-letter version is the most popular. Several versions of this game are
      available for Computer & Mobile devices. The first official massively multiplayer (MMO) version of this game was first
      made available for Android devices under the name WORD - Multiplayer Word Game. The Game play for letter version of
      this game is as follows.</p>
    <p>A person (Host) thinks of any isogram word, and gives out the number of letters in the word.</p>
    <p>Other players (Guessers) try to figure that word by guessing isogram words containing the same number of letters.</p>
    <p>Host responds with the number of Cows & Bulls for each guessed word. As with the digit version, "Cow" means a letter
      in the wrong position, while "Bull" means a letter in the right position.</p>
    <p>For example, if the secret word is HEAT, a guess of COIN would result in "0 Bulls, 0 Cows" (all of the guessed
      letters are wrong); a guess of EATS would result in "0 Bulls, 3 Cows" (since E, A, T are all present, but not in the
      guessed positions), and a guess of TEAL would result in "2 Bulls, 1 Cow" (since E and A are in the right positions,
      while T is in the wrong position). The game would continue until someone scores "4 Bulls" for guessing HEAT exactly.</p>
